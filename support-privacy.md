# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy describes in detail how the Sandstorm Support Service ("the service"), as run by Sandstorm Development Group, Inc. ("we"/"us"), protects your privacy.

This policy does NOT apply to the Sandstorm software itself, which runs on your own server and is governed by [the Sandstorm license](https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/blob/master/LICENSE). This policy also does not cover any other service provided by us, such as Sandstorm Oasis.

## Introduction

The Sandcats Support Service provides automatic updates for Sandstorm software that you run on your own server, "feature keys" which can be used to unlock features in that software, and email-based technical support.

## Data gathered when downloading updates updates

When you download an update from our server, we record in our logs:

* The IP address from which the request originated.
* The reason for the request, such as "daily update check", "first-time install", "emergency update due to failure to start", etc.

This information is kept in logs held for a maximum of 30 days and is not shared with third parties.

We may use this information to generate aggregate, anonymized statistics, such as the number of servers requesting updates and the rough geographic locations of those servers. These statistics may be stored indefinitely and shared with anyone.

## Data gathered when requesting a feature key

When you request a feature key, we may gather:

* Your organization's name and address.
* The name and email address of the primary contact at that organization.
* The number of users you wish your server to support, and other constraints of the feature key.
* Billing and payment information to pay for the service.
* Details about you and your and your organization to help us determine the best way to support you.
* Any other information listed on the sign-up form.

This information is used to deliver the service to you. The billing information will not be shared with anyone. We assume the remaining information is non-secret and we may share it with business partners unless you tell us otherwise.

## Data deletion

You may request that we delete any of this data by emailing [support@sandstorm.io](mailto:support@sandstorm.io). This may require cancelling your service.

## Effective Date

This policy is effective as of March 8, 2016.
