## Overview

Sandstorm is a platform for server-oriented and web-based applications. Sandstorm the platform is open source; anyone can run Sandstorm on their own personal server hardware. When you run Sandstorm on your own hardware, you can do anything you want with it: Sandstorm the platform is licensed under the Apache 2.0 open source license which places no restrictions on usage.

Sandstorm the company (Sandstorm Development Group, Inc.) also offers a managed hosting service ("the service"), which allows you to run Sandstorm (the platform) on our physical servers instead of your own. When you sign up for the service, you pay Sandstorm (the company) a monthly fee for access to a private server running a variant of Sandstorm (the platform). On this server you may install and run any application software (apps) you want, subject to a monthly resource allowance defined by your chosen subscription plan.

When you install an app on Sandstorm, you may use it to create multiple instances of the app, known as "grains". The meaning of a "grain" depends on the app. For instance, if you use a document editor app to create several documents, each document may be a separate grain. Grains are isolated from each other and inaccessible to other users unless and until you specify otherwise through the Sandstorm user interface. For example, you can "share" a document grain to other users in order to collaborate on the document, or you can make it public for the whole world to read, but until you do one of these things, the document is accessible only to you.

You must be at least 18 years old to access Sandstorm or to use the Sandstorm services or platform, regardless of the age requirements of any app you choose to run on Sandstorm. (This restriction may be lifted in the future, once Sandstorm complies with applicable regulations.)

## Terms of Service

### What you may do with the services:

As long as you keep your documents private, you can do anything you want with them (within the bounds of applicable law). Employees of Sandstorm (the company) will not look at your private data unless required by law (and we will push back against unreasonable law enforcement requests as we deem appropriate).

### What you may not do with the services:

* You may not use the service for activities that are illegal under United States law.
* You may not use the service to facilitate online harassment campaigns, regardless of legality. "Online harassment" means activity meant to threaten, bully, or otherwise maliciously make life difficult for an individual person or class of people, especially (but not limited to) women and minorities.
* You may not use the service to host commercial pornography. However, you may host personal erotic content as long as it legal and not for profit.

### Technical usage:

You may only access the service—and grains not owned by yourself—in ways that are intended to be allowed via the interface and APIs. If you identify a bug in the service or in any app or grain, you may not exploit it for any reason including but not limited to producing unintended consequences harmful to the service or the app or grain owner. Such activity may result in the suspension of your account, and may also be illegal under cybercrime law and may be prosecuted by either Sandstorm or by the grain owner. 

You may, however, test a bug to see if it exists as long as no other users are meaningfully affected and the bug is immediately responsibly disclosed to the relevant software maintainers. For bugs in any software maintained by Sandstorm (the company), email security@sandstorm.io. It is fully within Sandstorm’s discretion to determine whether your conduct with respect to bugs is harmful or not and Sandstorm may take any action it deems necessary to prevent harmful consequences to the service.

### Sharing and reporting:

If you choose to share a grain with other users (whether specific people, or publicly / to everyone), then certain rules come into play. First, any person with whom you share a grain has the right to re-share their access to other people. The Sandstorm user interface may offer you options for restricting this re-sharing, but these are voluntary on the part of the recipient; any user who can see your content can always copy/paste the content or take a screenshot.

Any person who has access to a grain may report the grain for violations of the policies enumerated below. When a user makes such a report, the complaining user is exercising their right to re-share your data to Sandstorm (the company). Once this has happened, Sandstorm may view your data in order to investigate the complaint. On the other hand, if none of the people to whom you share your data ever decides to share it with Sandstorm employees, then Sandstorm employees will not view the grain's data (unless required by law), regardless of the possibility of policy violations.  To be clear, this section does not apply to violations of the technical usage guidelines set forth above relating to the exploitation of bugs found in the service or any app or grain.  If the harmful exploitation of a bug is identified, Sandstorm may take whatever action it deems necessary to address the situation including but not limited to accessing your data to stop the exploitation and identify the source. 

### How Sandstorm will handle complaints:

When a shared grain has been reported to us, we will investigate it for compliance with the rules enumerated in these terms. In all cases, Sandstorm (the company) will judge whether the grain violates the policy. If it is found to be in violation, the following actions may be taken:

* Your grain may be "unshared", meaning no one except you will be able to access it, and it will not be able to connect to any external service or resources.
* In the case of repeat offenders or egregious violations, all of your grains may be unshared, and you may be prohibited from sharing grains or otherwise connecting grains to external resources in the future.
* If required by law -- but not otherwise -- your content will be permanently deleted. For example, we are required to delete child pornography.
* If required by law -- but not otherwise -- we will notify law enforcement. For example, we are required to report child pornography.
* In the case of harassment, if in our judgment the case warrants it (such as if you make explicit death threats towards an individual), we may reveal your identity to anyone who might be interested, such as to the harassed parties or to your mother.

### Copyright and Trademark Issues

To notify Sandstorm that there has been a copyright or trademark violation, please follow the specific instructions in (A) for filing a trademark claim, or (B) filing a copyright complaint, below.

If you are responding to a complaint of infringement, you will need to follow our Counter Notification policy in (C), below.

#### A. Trademark Claims

If you (the "Complaining Party") would like to submit a trademark claim for violation of a mark on which you hold a valid, registered trademark or service mark (registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on the Principal Register or, for foreign marks, registered with the appropriate intellectual property organization of your country; state registrations and registrations on the Supplemental Register are not considered valid for these purposes), Sandstorm requests that the Complaining Party substantiate such claim by providing the following information via email to [trademark@sandstorm.io](mailto:trademark@sandstorm.io).  The words "Trademark Claim" should appear in the subject line.

To be considered effective, a notification of a claimed trademark violation must include the following information:

* The trademark, service mark, trade dress, name, or other indicia of origin ("mark") that is claimed to be infringed, including registration number.
* The jurisdiction or geographical area to which the mark applies.
* The name, post office address and telephone number of the owner of the mark identified above.
* The goods and/or services covered by or offered under the mark identified above.
* The date of first use of the mark identified above.
* The date of first use in interstate commerce of the mark identified above.
* A description of the manner in which the Complaining Party believes its mark is being infringed upon.
* Sufficient evidence that the owner of the website that is claimed to be infringing is a Sandstorm customer.
* The precise location of the infringing mark, including electronic mail address, etc.
* A good faith certification, signed under penalty of perjury, stating:
* The content of the website [identify website] infringes the rights of another party,
* The name of such said party,
* The mark [identify mark] being infringed, and
* That use of the content of the website claimed to be infringing at issue is not defensible.

Upon receipt of the appropriate information identified above, for trademark claims, Sandstorm will initiate an investigation and forward the Complaining Party’s written notification to the alleged infringer. While Sandstorm is investigating the claim, Sandstorm, at its sole discretion and without any legal obligation to do so, may temporarily remove the allegedly infringing material from its site or temporarily remove or deny access to the allegedly infringing material.

If Sandstorm concludes that the Complaining Party has raised a legitimate trademark claim, it may, at its sole discretion and without any legal obligation to do so, permanently remove the challenged material from the site, continue to suspend the alleged infringer's Sandstorm account and/or if it is solely stored on a Sandstorm server, deny access to the allegedly infringing material. If Sandstorm concludes that the Complaining Party has not raised a legitimate claim, Sandstorm will restore access to the allegedly infringing material (or not take any action at all, as the case may be).

#### B. Copyright Claims

If the Complaining Party would like to submit a copyright claim for material on which you hold a bona fide copyright, Sandstorm requests that the Complaining Party substantiate such claim by providing Sandstorm with the following information via email to copyright@sandstorm.io. The words "Copyright Claim" should appear in the subject line. A copyright claim can also be submitted by mail to: 

    Copyright Agent
    Sandstorm Development Group, Inc.
    475 Fernando Ave
    Palo Alto, CA 94306

To be considered effective, a notification of a claimed copyright infringement must be provided to Sandstorm and must include the following information:

* An electronic signature of the copyright owner, or a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive copyright that has allegedly been infringed.
* Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works on that site.
* Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit Sandstorm to locate the material.
* Information reasonably sufficient to permit Sandstorm to contact the Complaining Party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which the Complaining Party may be contacted.
* A statement that the Complaining Party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
* A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the Complaining Party is the owner, or is authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

For Copyright Claims, upon receipt of appropriate and complete notification from the Complaining Party, Sandstorm will forward the Complaining Party's written notification to the alleged infringer and, if it is solely stored on a Sandstorm server, temporarily remove or deny access to the allegedly infringing material.

#### C. Counter Notification Policy

Counter Notification. If you have received a notice of copyright or trademark infringement that you wish to challenge based on a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled, you may provide Counter Notification by emailing or mailing us using the address from which you received notification of the takedown, and including the following:

* An electronic signature of the alleged infringer.
* Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled.
* A statement under penalty of perjury that the alleged infringer has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.
* The alleged infringer's name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that the Infringer consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the Northern District of California, or if the alleged infringer's address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which Sandstorm may be found, and that the alleged infringer will accept service of process from the Complaining Party or its agent.

Upon receipt of a Counter Notification as described in Section 1 above, Sandstorm will promptly provide the Complaining Party with a copy of the Counter Notification, and inform such Party that it will replace the removed material or cease disabling access to it in ten (10) business days. Sandstorm will replace the removed material and cease disabling access to it in not less than ten (10), nor more than fourteen (14), business days following receipt of the Counter Notification, unless Sandstorm first receives notice from the Complaining Party that such Complaining Party has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the alleged infringer from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on Sandstorm's system or network.

#### D. Repeat Infringers

It is Sandstorm's policy to provide for the termination, in appropriate circumstances, of Sandstorm customers and account holders who repeatedly violate this policy or are repeat infringers of copyrighted works, trademarks or any other intellectual property.
