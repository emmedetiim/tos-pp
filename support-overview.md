# Overview: Sandstorm Support Service

Sandstorm is a platform for server-oriented and web-based applications. Sandstorm the platform is open source; anyone can run Sandstorm on their own personal server hardware. When you run Sandstorm on your own hardware, you can do anything you want with it: Sandstorm the platform is licensed under the Apache 2.0 open source license which places no restrictions on usage.

"Sandstorm for Work" refers to a set of features within Sandstorm which are especially useful when deploying Sandstorm within a business or other organization. These features are part of Sandstorm and therefore are also open source. However, in official builds, they may require a special key to unlock.

Sandstorm Development Group, Inc., the developers of Sandstorm, additionally offer a service -- the Sandstorm Support Service -- in conjuction with the Sandstorm software. This service has two parts: **Automatic Updates** and **Priority Email Support**.

Automatic Updates are provided free of charge to everyone. However, in the official builds distributed by our update server, Sandstorm for Work features can only be enabled by providing a "feature key". We provide these keys to users with a paid subscription to the Sandstorm Support Service.
