## Overview

Sandstorm is a platform for server-oriented and web-based applications. Sandstorm the platform is open source; anyone can run Sandstorm on their own personal server hardware. When you run Sandstorm on your own hardware, you can do anything you want with it: Sandstorm the platform is licensed under the Apache 2.0 open source license which places no restrictions on usage.

Sandstorm the company (Sandstorm Development Group, Inc.) also offers a managed hosting service ("the service"), which allows you to run Sandstorm (the platform) on our physical servers instead of your own. When you sign up for the service, you pay Sandstorm (the company) a monthly fee for access to a private server running a variant of Sandstorm (the platform). On this server you may install and run any application software (apps) you want, subject to a monthly resource allowance defined by your chosen subscription plan.

When you install an app on Sandstorm, you may use it to create multiple instances of the app, known as "grains". The meaning of a "grain" depends on the app. For instance, if you use a document editor app to create several documents, each document may be a separate grain. Grains are isolated from each other and inaccessible to other users unless and until you specify otherwise through the Sandstorm user interface. For example, you can "share" a document grain to other users in order to collaborate on the document, or you can make it public for the whole world to read, but until you do one of these things, the document is accessible only to you.

You must be at least 18 years old to access Sandstorm or to use the Sandstorm services or platform, regardless of the age requirements of any app you choose to run on Sandstorm. (This restriction may be lifted in the future, once Sandstorm complies with applicable regulations.)

## Privacy Policy 

Sandstorm (the company, the service, and the platform) does not employ any automated "data-mining" algorithms that look at the content of your grains. We do not serve advertising and do not build an advertising profile about you. We do not sell or give away any personal data to any third party.

In general, you have a high degree of control over how your data is shared via the sharing UI. You, as a user, decide with whom your data and personal details are shared through the Sandstorm interface.

### Data gathered in the aggregate:

Sandstorm gathers aggregated data counts, such as "the number of people who logged in yesterday" or "the number of documents created using Etherpad". These counts aggregate data from many users and are not personally identifiable. We try not to gather statistics that may be personally identifiable; for example, if an application is installed by only one user, we will not gather statistics about it.

### Data gathered from you:

Sandstorm intends only to gather your personal data in ways that are clear and obvious from the user interface. If you believe that your personal data is being used in a way that you did not expect or authorize, email [privacy@sandstorm.io](mailto:privacy@sandstorm.io) to report the problem.

Sandstorm gathers a few pieces of personal "profile information" for the purpose of identifying you to other people on the service. These include:

* Your name.
* Your email address.
* Your profile picture or avatar.
* Your unique user ID corresponding to the login service(s) you used to authenticate (for example, your Github username, if you log in using Github).
* Other personal information which you add to your profile.

All of this data is voluntary; you can edit (or remove) the information through your account settings. **[Beta note: The ability to edit profile information may not be implemented yet, but we will add it before the beta ends. In the meantime, you may contact [support@sandsotrm.io](mailto:support@sandstorm.io) if you would like any information changed or removed.**

When you use Sandstorm to share data with other people, or when you access data shared with you by other Sandstorm users, your profile information may be revealed to the other users with whom you are connecting, so that they can identify you.

### Data gathered through applications:

Individual Sandstorm apps may gather arbitrary personal data about you. Sandstorm does not control the behavior of these apps. To understand how the application uses your data, please consult the app's own documentation, privacy policy, and terms of use.

Sandstorm allows you to control how an app is shared with other users. It is our intent that an application cannot communicate with any other party unless you explicitly permit it to do so via the Sandstorm user interface, and the Sandstorm platform is designed to enforce this at a technical level. However, it is possible that a defect in the software will allow an application to bypass this policy. Any such defects should be immediately reported to [security@sandstorm.io](mailto:security@sandstorm.io).

If you permit it, a Sandstorm app may connect to third parties and transmit arbitrary data to and from that third party. Once you have given an app permission to talk to a third party, Sandstorm cannot make any guarantees about what data it sends to or receives from that party. You must consult the privacy policy and terms of use of that app to find out how it functions, what data it takes, and what it does with that data.  Sandstorm does not control any of these functions.  If you have a complaint about the handling of your data by an app, that complaint must be taken to the app provider, not Sandstorm. Sandstorm is not responsible for the conduct of the apps.

If you connect to a grain owned by another user (for example, a document shared with you), any information you communicate to that grain becomes controlled by the user who owns the grain. Sandstorm cannot control what that user does with the data and is not responsible for what the user does with that data, even where you believe such use violates Sandstorm’s policies. The user may offer their own privacy policy governing the data, but Sandstorm's privacy policy does not apply.

### Data gathered through third parties:

**Payment provider:** Sandstorm collects payments through Stripe. Your payment information, such as your credit card number and billing address, is stored only by Stripe, not by Sandstorm.  Please see Stripe’s privacy policy and terms of use here.

**Third-party log in:** If you sign in through a third-party login service like Google or Github, we collect information from it in order to populate your profile information, as described above. This information may be edited or removed through your account settings.

### Data gathered automatically:

**Logs:** Sandstorm collects logs for the purpose of system health monitoring, debugging, and security. Logs may record events like "User 'kenton' logged in from IP address 192.168.1.10," "App Etherpad version 1.5.6 was successfully installed," or "Error: Database claims Etherpad is installed but I can't find the files on disk!" These logs are only examined in the event that they are needed to resolve a problem (a software bug, a service outage, or a security breach), and can only be accessed by Sandstorm employees or internal fully-automated systems tasked with detecting and resolving these problems. Content of a grain (i.e. your data) is never stored to these logs. These logs are stored on Sandstorm's servers.

**IP Address:** We may store your IP address as part of our logs. We may share your IP address to facilitate connections between yourself and other users, such as setting up a real-time video conference. We do not otherwise share your IP address with third parties.

**Cookies and local storage:** We use cookies and browser local storage for authentication and security purposes. We do not track users across third-party sites, with cookies or otherwise.

### Data Storage Location:

All data we collect is stored in the United States on servers at our infrastructure service provider, Google Cloud Services, which stores this data encrypted at rest. Google Cloud Services' [Terms of Service](https://cloud.google.com/terms/), section 5, states that Google will use data stored through the service only to deliver the service; data will not be used in conjunction with Google's other products, including advertising products.

### What we do with the information we gather:

We use any information we gather to improve the services we offer.

We do not sell any personal data to any third party. We do not share personal data with any third party, except as necessary to implement the service. For instance, if you choose to log in through Github, then we share data with Github, but only as necessary to implement login. If you believe we are sharing more data than necessary, please email [privacy@sandstorm.io](mailto:privacy@sandstorm.io) to report the problem so we may fix it.

If we merge with another company or are acquired by another company, we will share all of the data we have gathered with that company. In this event, Sandstorm will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

We also may share your data with authorities or other third parties to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our [Terms of Service](TODO: terms-of-service), or as otherwise required by law. Any such action will be consistent with the policies and guidelines included in our Terms of Service.

### How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals:

The [W3C "Do Not Track" standard](http://www.w3.org/TR/tracking-dnt/) defines "tracking" as follows:

> **_Tracking_** is the collection of data regarding a particular user's activity across multiple distinct contexts and the retention, use, or sharing of data derived from that activity outside the context in which it occurred. A **_context_** is a set of resources that are controlled by the same party or jointly controlled by a set of parties.

Sandstorm, as a company, does not engage in "tracking", in that we do not track users across multiple unrelated contexts or web sites without the user's explicit consent. This applies regardless of the presence of "Do Not Track" signals.

### EU Safe Harbor:

When you choose to provide Sandstorm with your information or any information that is automatically gathered through your use of Sandstorm, you consent to the transfer and storage of that information on our servers located in the United States.

Sandstorm adheres to the US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of Notice, Choice, Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity, Access and Enforcement, and is registered with the U.S. Department of Commerce's Safe Harbor Program [TODO: provide link to the program and Sandstorm listing] 

For European Union and Swiss residents, any questions or concerns regarding the use or disclosure of your information should be directed to Sandstorm by sending an email to [privacy@sandstorm.io](mailto:privaty@sandstorm.io). We will investigate and attempt to resolve complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of your information in accordance with our Privacy Policy. For complaints that cannot be resolved, and consistent with the Safe Harbor Enforcement Principle, we have committed to cooperate with data protection authorities located within Switzerland or the European Union (or their authorized representatives).

### Correcting and deleting your data:

Most things can be edited through the Sandstorm interface, but if not, email [support@sandstorm.io](mailto:support@sandstorm.io).

Sandstorm will not edit content owned by other users (which is most of the content on the platform).

### Cancellation:

If you cancel your service, all of your data (including grains) will be deleted. However, if you merely stop paying for your service without requesting cancellation, then Sandstorm may, as a courtesy, continue to store your data so that you may access it again once you resume payments. Either you or Sandstorm may choose to end this courtesy storage at any time. You may cancel your service through the user interface or you can contact us at [support@sandstorm.io](mailto:support@sandstorm.io).
