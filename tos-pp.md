## Overview

Sandstorm is a platform for server-oriented and web-based applications. Sandstorm the platform is open source; anyone can run Sandstorm on their own personal server hardware. When you run Sandstorm on your own hardware, you can do anything you want with it: Sandstorm the platform is licensed under the Apache 2.0 open source license which places no restrictions on usage.

Sandstorm the company (Sandstorm Development Group, Inc.) also offers a managed hosting service ("the service"), which allows you to run Sandstorm (the platform) on our physical servers instead of your own. When you sign up for the service, you pay Sandstorm (the company) a monthly fee for access to a private server running a variant of Sandstorm (the platform). On this server you may install and run any application software (apps) you want, subject to a monthly resource allowance defined by your chosen subscription plan.

When you install an app on Sandstorm, you may use it to create multiple instances of the app, known as "grains". The meaning of a "grain" depends on the app. For instance, if you use a document editor app to create several documents, each document may be a separate grain. Grains are isolated from each other and inaccessible to other users unless and until you specify otherwise through the Sandstorm user interface. For example, you can "share" a document grain to other users in order to collaborate on the document, or you can make it public for the whole world to read, but until you do one of these things, the document is accessible only to you.

You must be at least 18 years old to access Sandstorm or to use the Sandstorm services or platform, regardless of the age requirements of any app you choose to run on Sandstorm. 

## Terms of Service

What you may do with the services:
As long as you keep your documents private, you can do anything you want with them (within the bounds of applicable law). Employees of Sandstorm (the company) will not look at your private data unless required by law (and we will push back against unreasonable law enforcement requests as we deem appropriate).

What you may not do with the services:
Please do not use our service to engage in any illegal activity.  Do not use the service to harass anyone.  And do not use the service for commercial pornography, but you may use the service for non-commercial pornography, e.g. an erotic personal blog. 

### Technical usage:

You may only access the service—and grains not owned by yourself—in ways that are intended to be allowed via the interface and APIs. If you identify a bug in the service or in any app or grain, you may not exploit it for any reason including but not limited to producing unintended consequences harmful to the service or the app or grain owner. Such activity may result in the suspension of your account, and may also be illegal under cybercrime law and may be prosecuted by either Sandstorm or by the grain owner. 

You may, however, test a bug to see if it exists as long as no other users are meaningfully affected and the bug is immediately responsibly disclosed to the relevant software maintainers. For bugs in any software maintained by Sandstorm (the company), email security@sandstorm.io. It is fully within Sandstorm’s discretion to determine whether your conduct with respect to bugs is harmful or not and Sandstorm may take any action it deems necessary to prevent harmful consequences to the service of any app. 

### Sharing and reporting:

If you choose to share a grain with other users (whether specific people, or publicly / to everyone), then certain rules come into play. First, any person with whom you share a grain has the right to re-share their access to other people. The Sandstorm user interface offers you options for restricting this re-sharing, but these are voluntary on the part of the recipient; any user who can see your content can always copy/paste the content or take a screenshot.

Any person who has access to a grain may report the grain for violations of the policies enumerated below. When a user makes such a report, the complaining user is exercising their right to re-share your data to Sandstorm (the company). Once this has happened, Sandstorm may view your data in order to investigate the complaint. On the other hand, if none of the people to whom you share your data ever decides to share it with Sandstorm employees, then Sandstorm employees will not view the grain's data (unless required by law), regardless of the possibility of policy violations.  To be clear, this section does not apply to violations of the technical usage guidelines set forth above relating to the exploitation of bugs found in the service or any app or grain.  If the harmful exploitation of a bug is identified, Sandstorm may take whatever action it deems necessary to address the situation including but not limited to accessing your data to stop the exploitation and identify the source. 

### How Sandstorm will handle complaints:

When a shared grain has been reported to us, we will investigate it for compliance with the following rules:

* You may not use the service for activities that are illegal under United States law.
* You may not use the service to facilitate online harassment campaigns, regardless of legality. "Online harassment" means activity meant to threaten, bully, or otherwise maliciously make life difficult for an individual person or class of people, especially (but not limited to) women and minorities.
* You may not use the service to host commercial pornography. However, you may host personal erotic content as long as it legal and not for profit.

In all cases, Sandstorm (the company) will judge whether the grain violates the policy. If it is found to be in violation, the following actions may be taken:

* Your grain may be "unshared", meaning no one except you will be able to access it, and it will not be able to connect to any external service or resources.
* In the case of repeat offenders or egregious violations, all of your grains may be unshared, and you may be prohibited from sharing grains or otherwise connecting grains to external resources in the future.
* If required by law -- but not otherwise -- your content will be permanently deleted. For example, we are required to delete child pornography.
* If required by law -- but not otherwise -- we will notify law enforcement. For example, we are required to report child pornography.
* In the case of harassment, if in our judgment the case warrants it (such as if you make explicit death threats towards an individual), we may reveal your identity to anyone who might be interested, such as to the harassed parties or to your mother.

### Copyright and Trademark Issues

To notify Sandstorm that there has been a copyright or trademark violation, please follow the specific instructions in (A) for filing a trademark claim, or (B) filing a copyright complaint, below.

If you are responding to a complaint of infringement, you will need to follow our Counter Notification policy in (C), below.

#### A. Trademark Claims

If you (the "Complaining Party") would like to submit a trademark claim for violation of a mark on which you hold a valid, registered trademark or service mark (registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on the Principal Register or, for foreign marks, registered with the appropriate intellectual property organization of your country; state registrations and registrations on the Supplemental Register are not considered valid for these purposes), Sandstorm requests that the Complaining Party substantiate such claim by providing the following information via email to trademark@sandstorm.io.  The words "Trademark Claim" should appear in the subject line.

To be considered effective, a notification of a claimed trademark violation must include the following information:

* The trademark, service mark, trade dress, name, or other indicia of origin ("mark") that is claimed to be infringed, including registration number.
* The jurisdiction or geographical area to which the mark applies.
* The name, post office address and telephone number of the owner of the mark identified above.
* The goods and/or services covered by or offered under the mark identified above.
* The date of first use of the mark identified above.
* The date of first use in interstate commerce of the mark identified above.
* A description of the manner in which the Complaining Party believes its mark is being infringed upon.
* Sufficient evidence that the owner of the website that is claimed to be infringing is a Sandstorm customer.
* The precise location of the infringing mark, including electronic mail address, etc.
* A good faith certification, signed under penalty of perjury, stating:
* The content of the website [identify website] infringes the rights of another party,
* The name of such said party,
* The mark [identify mark] being infringed, and
* That use of the content of the website claimed to be infringing at issue is not defensible.

Upon receipt of the appropriate information identified above, for trademark claims, Sandstorm will initiate an investigation and forward the Complaining Party’s written notification to the alleged infringer. While Sandstorm is investigating the claim, Sandstorm, at its sole discretion and without any legal obligation to do so, may temporarily remove the allegedly infringing material from its site or temporarily remove or deny access to the allegedly infringing material.

If Sandstorm concludes that the Complaining Party has raised a legitimate trademark claim, it may, at its sole discretion and without any legal obligation to do so, permanently remove the challenged material from the site, continue to suspend the alleged infringer's Sandstorm account and/or if it is solely stored on a Sandstorm server, deny access to the allegedly infringing material. If Sandstorm concludes that the Complaining Party has not raised a legitimate claim, Sandstorm will restore access to the allegedly infringing material (or not take any action at all, as the case may be).

#### B. Copyright Claims

If the Complaining Party would like to submit a copyright claim for material on which you hold a bona fide copyright, Sandstorm requests that the Complaining Party substantiate such claim by providing Sandstorm with the following information via email to copyright@sandstorm.io. The words "Copyright Claim" should appear in the subject line. A copyright claim can also be submitted by mail to: 

    Copyright Agent
    Sandstorm Development Group, Inc.
    475 Fernando Ave
    Palo Alto, CA 94306

To be considered effective, a notification of a claimed copyright infringement must be provided to Sandstorm and must include the following information:

* An electronic signature of the copyright owner, or a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive copyright that has allegedly been infringed.
* Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works on that site.
* Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit Sandstorm to locate the material.
* Information reasonably sufficient to permit Sandstorm to contact the Complaining Party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which the Complaining Party may be contacted.
* A statement that the Complaining Party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
* A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the Complaining Party is the owner, or is authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

For Copyright Claims, upon receipt of appropriate and complete notification from the Complaining Party, Sandstorm will forward the Complaining Party's written notification to the alleged infringer and, if it is solely stored on a Sandstorm server, temporarily remove or deny access to the allegedly infringing material.

#### C. Counter Notification Policy

Counter Notification. If you have received a notice of copyright or trademark infringement that you wish to challenge based on a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled, you may provide Counter Notification by emailing or mailing us using the address from which you received notification of the takedown, and including the following:

* An electronic signature of the alleged infringer.
* Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled.
* A statement under penalty of perjury that the alleged infringer has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.
* The alleged infringer's name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that the Infringer consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the Northern District of California, or if the alleged infringer's address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which Sandstorm may be found, and that the alleged infringer will accept service of process from the Complaining Party or its agent.

Upon receipt of a Counter Notification as described in Section 1 above, Sandstorm will promptly provide the Complaining Party with a copy of the Counter Notification, and inform such Party that it will replace the removed material or cease disabling access to it in ten (10) business days. Sandstorm will replace the removed material and cease disabling access to it in not less than ten (10), nor more than fourteen (14), business days following receipt of the Counter Notification, unless Sandstorm first receives notice from the Complaining Party that such Complaining Party has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the alleged infringer from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on Sandstorm's system or network.

#### D. Repeat Infringers

It is Sandstorm's policy to provide for the termination, in appropriate circumstances, of Sandstorm customers and account holders who repeatedly violate this policy or are repeat infringers of copyrighted works, trademarks or any other intellectual property.

**Modifications to these Terms of Service.** Sandstorm has included the effective date of these Terms of Service on the last page of this document. Sandstorm reserves the right to make changes to any of the Terms of Service at any time, however, Sandstorm shall provide notification to you in advance of any changes becoming effective, such as by posting a notification on the Sandstorm Websites or via e-mail. If you continue to access and/or use the services available through the Sandstorm platform and/or any third party platform after the effective date of such changes, then such access and/or use will be deemed an acceptance of and an agreement to follow and be bound by the Terms of Service as changed. The revised Terms of Service supersede all previous notices or statements regarding the services. For this reason, we encourage you to review these Terms of Service any time you access or use the Sandstorm Websites or platform, or any third party platform through which the services are offered, and recommend that you print out a copy for your records. Upon our request, you agree to accept or sign a non-electronic version of these Terms of Service and any other policies or agreements set forth or available on or through the Sandstorm Websites, Sandstorm platform, or any third party platform.

**Notice.** Except as explicitly stated otherwise, legal notices will be served on Sandstorm’s national registered agent or to the e-mail address you provide to Sandstorm during the registration process. Notice will be deemed given twenty-four hours after e-mail is sent, unless the sending party is notified that the e-mail address is invalid. Alternatively, we may give you legal notice by mail to a postal address, if provided by you through your registration for any of the services. In such case, notice will be deemed given three days after the date of mailing.

**Waiver.** The failure of Sandstorm to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Any waiver of any provision of the Terms will be effective only if in writing and signed by Sandstorm.

**Agreement to Arbitrate and Class Action Waiver.**

THIS SECTION ONLY APPLIES TO USERS IN THE US AND CANADA. 

Before bringing a formal legal case, please first try contacting us or try to find a resolution on one of our forums. Most disputes can be resolved that way. 

**We Both Agree to Arbitrate.** If we can’t resolve our dispute, you and Sandstorm agree to resolve any claims relating to the Terms through final and binding arbitration. This applies to all kinds of claims under any legal theory. 

Either of us can bring a claim in small claims court either in San Francisco, California, or the county where you live, or some other place we both agree on, if it qualifies to be brought in that court. 

In addition, if you or Sandstorm brings a claim in court that should be arbitrated or any of us refuses to arbitrate a claim that should be arbitrated, the other of us can ask a court to force us to go to arbitration to resolve the claim (i.e., compel arbitration). You or Sandstorm may also ask a court to halt a court proceeding while an arbitration proceeding is ongoing. 

**No Class Actions.** We all agree that we can only bring a claim against each other on an individual basis. That means: (a) neither you nor Sandstorm can bring a claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class action, consolidated action or representative action; (b) an arbitrator cannot combine more than one person’s claim into a single case, and cannot preside over any consolidated, class or representative arbitration proceeding (unless we both agree to change this); (c) an arbitrator’s decision or award in one person’s case can only impact the person who brought the claim, not other Sandstorm users, and cannot be used to decide other disputes with other users. If a court decides that this subsection on "No Class Actions" is not enforceable or valid, then the entire Section 32 (Agreement to Arbitrate and Class Action Waiver) will be null and void, but, the rest of the Terms of Service will still apply. 

**The Arbitration Process.** Any disputes between you and Sandstorm relating to the Website or the Services that involve a claim of less than US$10,000 must be resolved exclusively through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. A party electing arbitration shall initiate proceedings by filing an arbitration demand with the American Arbitration Association (AAA). The arbitration proceedings shall be governed by the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules, Consumer Due Process Protocol, and Supplementary Procedures for Resolution of Consumer-Related Disputes. In addition, you and Sandstorm agree that the following rules shall apply to the arbitration proceedings: (a) the arbitration shall be conducted, at the option of the party seeking relief, by telephone, online, or based solely on written submissions; (b) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and (c) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Any disputes between you and Sandstorm relating to the Website or the Services that involve a claim of less than US$10,000 must be resolved in accordance with the AAA’s rules about whether the arbitration hearing has to be in-person. 

**Governing Law.** The Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, United States of America, without regards to its principles of conflicts of law that would require the application of the laws of another jurisdiction, and shall be considered to have been made and accepted in the State of California.

**Jurisdiction for Legal Disputes Not Subject to Arbitration.** If the Agreement to Arbitrate is determined to be invalid or unenforceable or for any disputes that do not qualify for arbitration, the dispute shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal and State courts located in San Francisco, California. You hereby consent and submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action.

**Severability.** If any provision of the Terms of Service is found to be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from the Terms of Service and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

**Assignment.** The Terms and any related rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you without Sandstorm’s prior written consent, but may be assigned by Sandstorm freely without restriction.

**Entire Agreement.** This is the entire agreement between you and Sandstorm relating to the subject matter herein and supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous written or oral agreements between us with respect to such subject matter.

**Miscellaneous.** No agency, partnership, joint venture, employee-employer or franchiser-franchisee relationship is intended or created by the Terms of Service. Any heading, caption or section title contained herein is inserted only as a matter of convenience and in no way defines or explains any section or provision hereof. Sandstorm’s performance of the Terms of Service is subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing contained in the Terms of Service is in derogation of Sandstorm’s right to comply with governmental, court, and law enforcement requests or requirements relating to your use of the services, including without limitation those available through third party platforms, and any information provided to or gathered by Sandstorm with respect to such use(s). A printed version of the Terms of Service and of any notices given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to the Terms of Service to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. The parties agree that all correspondence relating to the Terms of Service must be written in the English language. Should you have any questions or concerns regarding these Terms of Service, please contact us as provided in these Terms of Service.

## Privacy Policy 

Sandstorm (the company, the service, and the platform) does not employ any automated "data-mining" algorithms that look at the content of your grains. We do not serve advertising and do not build an advertising profile about you. We do not sell or give away any personal data to any third party.

In general, you have a high degree of control over how your data is shared via the sharing UI. If you never share any of your content with other users, and never use your identity to authenticate to other users' content, then there is little to opt out of and there is little collected and stored by Sandstorm.

### Data gathered in the aggregate:

Sandstorm gathers aggregated data counts, such as "the number of people who logged in yesterday" or "the number of documents created using Etherpad". These counts aggregate data from many users and are not personally identifiable. We try not to gather statistics that may be personally identifiable; for example, if an application is installed by only one user, we will not gather statistics about it.

### Data gathered through you:

Sandstorm intends only to gather your personal data in ways that are clear and obvious from the user interface. If you believe that your personal data is being used in a way that you did not expect or authorize, email privacy@sandstorm.io to report the problem.

Sandstorm gathers a few pieces of personal "profile information" for the purpose of identifying you to other people on the service. These include:

* Your name.
* Your email address.
* Your profile picture or avatar.
* Other personal information which you add to your profile.
* Your IP address is collected here, though you do not provide it to us, we collect it automatically.

All of this data is voluntary; you can edit (or remove) the information through your account settings. 

When you use Sandstorm to share data with other people, or when you access data shared with you by other Sandstorm users, your profile information may be revealed to the other users with whom you are connecting, so that they can identify you. 

### Data gathered through third parties:

#### Applications:

Individual Sandstorm apps may gather arbitrary personal data about you. Sandstorm does not control the behavior of these apps. Please always check the privacy policy and terms of use of any app you install on Sandstorm or that you use. 

Sandstorm allows you to control how an app is shared with other users. It is our intent that an application cannot communicate with any other party unless you explicitly permit it to do so via the Sandstorm user interface, and the Sandstorm platform is designed to enforce this at a technical level. However, it is possible that a defect in the software will allow an application to bypass this policy. Any such defects should be immediately reported to security@sandstorm.io. 

If you permit it, a Sandstorm app may connect to third parties and transmit arbitrary data to and from that third party. Once you have given an app permission to talk to a third party, Sandstorm cannot make any guarantees about what data it sends to or receives from that party. You must consult the privacy policy and terms of use of that app to find out how it functions, what data it takes, and what it does with that data.  Sandstorm does not control any of these functions.  If you have a complaint about the handling of your data by an app, that complaint must be taken to the app provider, not Sandstorm. Sandstorm is not responsible for the conduct of the apps.

If you connect to a grain owned by another user (for example, a document shared with you), any information you communicate to that grain becomes controlled by the user who owns the grain. Sandstorm cannot control what that user does with the data and is not responsible for what the user does with that data, even where you believe such use violates Sandstorm’s policies. The user may offer their own privacy policy governing the data, but Sandstorm's privacy policy does not apply.

#### Payment provider:

Sandstorm collects payments through Stripe. Your payment information, such as your credit card number and billing address, is stored only by Stripe, not by Sandstorm.  P lease see Stripe’s privacy policy and terms of use here.

#### Third-party log in:

If you sign in through a third-party login service like Google or Github, we collect your basic profile information from it (typically full name, email address, profile picture).
[Is there an opportunity to delete or modify this information later?]

### Data gathered automatically:

Sandstorm collects logs for the purpose of system health monitoring, debugging, and security. Logs may record events like "User 'kenton' logged in from IP address 192.168.1.10," "App Etherpad version 1.5.6 was successfully installed," or "Error: Database claims Etherpad is installed but I can't find the files on disk!" These logs are only examined in the event that they are needed to resolve a problem (a software bug, a service outage, or a security breach), and can only be accessed by Sandstorm employees or internal fully-automated systems tasked with detecting and resolving these problems. Content of a grain (i.e. your data) is never stored to these logs.

We use cookies for authentication purposes.  Can be used for tracking and other things, like here, to make sure you are the user that has access to the data.  We use cookies and local storage for authentication and security purposes but not to track users.

#### Data Storage:

All data we collect is stored on our servers in the United States.
 
### What we do with the information we gather:

We use any information we gather to improve the services we offer.

We do not sell or give away any personal data to any third party.  If we merge with another company or are acquired by another company, we will share all of the data we have gathered with that company.

We also may share your data with authorities or other third parties to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service [live link], or as otherwise required by law. Any such action will be consistent with the policies and guidelines included in our Terms of Service.

### How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals:

Because people are often unaware that their do-not-track beacons are active, do-not-track does not frequently reflect the actual preferences of our users.  Accordingly, we do not respond to the federal Do-Not-Track signal.

### EU Safe Harbor:
When you choose to provide Sandstorm with your information or any information that is automatically gathered through your use of Sandstorm, you consent to the transfer and storage of that information on our servers located in the United States.

Sandstorm adheres to the US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of Notice, Choice, Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity, Access and Enforcement, and is registered with the U.S. Department of Commerce's Safe Harbor Program [provide link to the program and Sandstorm listing] 

For European Union and Swiss residents [is this applicable?], any questions or concerns regarding the use or disclosure of your information should be directed to Sandstorm by sending an email to [privacy@sandstorm.io]. We will investigate and attempt to resolve complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of your information in accordance with our Privacy Policy. For complaints that cannot be resolved, and consistent with the Safe Harbor Enforcement Principle, we have committed to cooperate with data protection authorities located within Switzerland or the European Union (or their authorized representatives).

### Correcting and deleting your data:

Most things can be edited through the Sandstorm interface, but if not, email support@sandstorm.io.

Sandstorm will not edit content owned by other users (which is most of the content on the platform).

### Cancellation:

If you cancel your service, all of your data (including grains) will be deleted. However, if you merely stop paying for your service, your data may not be deleted, but rather stored in long-term storage until you either resume payments or cancel. You may cancel your service through the user interface or you can contact us at support@sandstorm.io.
